  Hey there! <br>
  <br>
  My name's Goose and I run this webpage as a sort of portfolio / blog.
  
  <br><br>
  I'm a soon-to-be student at Fanshawe College (in London, Ontario), studying to be an aviation technician. I'm fascinated by mechanical gadgets and gizmos. I find there's something magic about the "hidden" engineering behind everyday items.

  <br><br>
  In my spare time, I enjoy taking part in urban exploration (exploring abandoned buildings), <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/goose060/albums/>photography</a>, and working on my ever-increasing list of projects. I have a huge variety of interests and hobbies, as well as an inhumane amount of curiousity about the way that the world works.
