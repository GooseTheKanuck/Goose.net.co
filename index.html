  Hey there! <br>
  <br>
  My name's Goose and I run this webpage as a sort of portfolio / blog.
  
  <br><br>
  I'm a student at Fanshawe College, studying to be an aviation technician. I'm fascinated by mechanical gadgets and gizmos. I find there's something magic about the "hidden" engineering behind everyday items.

  <br><br>
  In my spare time, I enjoy taking part in urban exploration, photography, and working on my ever-increasing list of projects. I like to consider myself, perhaps pretentiously, as an "amateur polymath". I have a huge variety of interests and hobbies, with very little formal education to back them up. You will find a small sample of those hobbies below.
