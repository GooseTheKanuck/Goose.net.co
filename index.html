  Hey there! <br>
  <br>
  My name's Goose and I run this webpage as a sort of portfolio / blog.
  
  <br><br>
  I'm a student at Fanshawe College, studying to be an aviation technician. I'm fascinated by mechanical gadgets and gizmos. I love learning about the "hidden" engineering behind everyday items.

  <br><br>
  In my spare time, I enjoy taking part in urban exploration, 3D printing, and photography. I dabble in many other hobbies as well, though they are too numerous to list.

  <br>

  Current Projects:

  : <a href=Nimdok.html>NIMDOK, a fully 3D printed beetleweight combat robot</a> 
  <br>
  <br>
  : <a href=urban_Decay.html> Urban Decay, a photo project exploring my fascination with the derelict and abandoned</a>
