   Since I was young, I've been fascinated by the way some things just become completely forgotten by mankind. At first, I was captivated by Pripyat, the city in the shadow of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The way that an entire city can just be left to ruin was (and is) fascinating to me. It seems impossible that tens of thousands of people can stage a mass exodus and just forget their lives behind.

   I like the decay of man-made things. From rusted fences, to abandoned factories, I like it all. The foreboding silence that comes with an abandoned building is so beautifully sobering. Many have walked the floors I photograph, many have spent their lives working or living in these spaces. Some called them home. Or their son's or daughter's homes. Some called them their workplace. What happened to them? What happened to these locations? Why are they left in complete disrepair? To me, they're like a crypt. A tomb of past lives and forgotten stories.
