  In fall of 2024, my father and I acquired a 1976 Triumph Spitfire for $1,500 (CAD), with the intention of fixing it up and selling it. There was (and still is) a myriad of problems with it.
<br>
  Some issues with it:
<br>
   <a href=/carb.html>- Carburetor isn't delivering fuel to the engine</a>
  <br>
  <a href=/brakes.html>- Brakes are soft, beyond the point of safety. The brake fluid reservoir was bone dry (although there are no leaks!)</a>
  <br>
  <a href=/missingParts.html>- She's missing a few cosmetic parts (luggage rack, roof trim, etc)</a>
