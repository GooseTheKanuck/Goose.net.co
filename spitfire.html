<body>
  In the Fall of 2024, my father and I acquired a 1976 Triumph Spitfire for $1,500 (CAD), with the intention of fixing it up and selling it. There was (and still is) a myriad of problems with it.
<br>
<br>
  Some issues with it:
<br>
<br>
   : Carburetor isn't delivering fuel to the engine
  <br>
  <br>
  : Brakes are soft, beyond the point of safety. The brake fluid reservoir was bone dry (although there are no leaks!)
  <br>
  <br>
  : She's missing a few cosmetic parts (luggage rack, roof trim, etc)
